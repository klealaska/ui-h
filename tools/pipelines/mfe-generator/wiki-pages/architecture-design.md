| LRR-Arch-1 | Application MUST not directly communicate with legacy datastores.<br>Legacy datastores are a historical source of coupling between applications. Coupling leads to challenges in testing because it can introduce requirements for connectivity to dependencies that can be challenging to deploy in an automated fashion.<br>Applications should be cohesive, but loosely coupled, and therefore only communicate via asynchronous messaging or API calls.                                                                   | Yes                      | Yes                      | UI applications do not connect directly to any data stores. Angular app communicates with BFF and BFF communicates with any additional services                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| LRR-Arch-2 | Application MUST be reviewed and approved by the [Architecture Review Board (ARB)](https://dev.azure.com/avidxchange/Architecture%20Center%20of%20Excellence/_wiki/wikis/Architecture-Center-of-Excellence.wiki/18502/Intake-Request).<br>Please provide a link to the output of ARB.<br>If your application was not reviewed and approved by the Architecture Review Board you can receive an exception by having your Architect certify the application uses already approved patterns per Architecture Guidance standards. | Yes                      | Yes                      | Monorepo approach, micro frontend approach, UI CoE deployment space, and use of CMS to decouple static text strings are all approved by ARB over the past two years.

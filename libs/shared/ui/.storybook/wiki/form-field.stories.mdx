# **Overview**

`<mat-form-field>` is a component used to wrap several Angular Material components and apply common Text field styles such as the underline, floating label, and hint messages.

"Form field" refers to the wrapper component `<mat-form-field>` and "form field control" refers to the component that the `<mat-form-field>` is wrapping (e.g. the input, textarea, select, etc.)

The following Angular Material components are designed to work inside a `<mat-form-field>`:

`<input matNativeControl>` and `<textarea matNativeControl>`
`<select matNativeControl>`
`<mat-select>`
`<mat-chip-list>`

# **Styles**

<img src={Forms} alt="Forms" />

# **Additional Specifications**

- Use the outline appearance variant wherever possible.
- Default to a field height that is smaller than than out-of-the-box.
- Increase the font size of the floating label and **bottom-align** it with the top of the field rather than center-aligning it.
- Must add `appearance="outline"` to the `mat-form-field` element.

# **Additional Accessibility Requirements**

None

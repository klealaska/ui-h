# **Overview**

`mat-icon` makes it easier to use vector-based icons in your app. This directive supports both icon fonts and SVG icons, but not bitmap-based formats (png, jpg, etc.).

Designers will indicate which Graphic or Basic icons should be used in the requirements of the card that corresponds to the request. The icons can be found in the repo for use. Devs must ensure they are using the exact `mat-icon` and tag specified by designers.

## Graphic Icons

- Graphic icons have more than one color

<img src={GraphicIcons} alt="GraphicIcons" />

## Basic Icons

- Basic icons only have one color

<img src={BasicIcons} alt="BasicIcons" />

##Icon Uses
Both Graphic and Basic icons can be placed in one of the below categories:

- **Decorative:** the icon conveys no real semantic meaning and is purely cosmetic
- **Interactive:** a user will click or otherwise interact with the icon to perform some action
- **Indicator:** the icon is not interactive, but it conveys some information, such as a status. This includes using the icon in place of text inside of a larger message

##Decorative icons
When the icon is purely cosmetic and conveys no real semantic meaning, the `<mat-icon>` element must be marked with `aria-hidden="true"`

##Interactive icons
Icons alone are not interactive elements for screen-reader users; when the user would interact with some icon on the page, a more appropriate element should "own" the interaction:

- The `<mat-icon>` element should be a child of a `<button>` or `<a>` element.

- The parent `<button>` or `<a>` should either have a meaningful label provided either through direct text content, aria-label, or `aria-labelledby`.

##Indicator icons
When the presence of an icon communicates some information to the user whether as an indicator or by being inlined into a block of text, that information must also be made available to screen-readers.

The most straightforward way to do this is to:

1. Add a `<span>` as an adjacent sibling to the `<mat-icon>` element with text that conveys the same information as the icon.

1. Add the cdk-visually-hidden class to the `<span>`. This will make the message invisible on-screen but still available to screen-reader users.

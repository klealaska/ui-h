# **Overview**

Typography is a way of arranging type to make text legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. Angular Material's theming system supports customizing the typography settings for the library's components. Additionally, Angular Material provides APIs for applying typography styles to elements in your own application.

Angular Material's theming APIs are built with Sass. This document assumes familiary with CSS and Sass basics, including variables, functions, and mixins.

All typography will overwrite all of the components _without the need to add anything to your code_.

## Badges

**A working example of this badges implementation can be found @ \_libs/shared/ui-v2/.storybook/components/badges.stories.ts **

Badges must always be applied to block-level elements.

Badges can be implemented by passing the below properties into the component.

**Badge position**

By default, the badge will be placed `above after`. The direction can be changed by defining the attribute `matBadgePosition` follow by `above|below` and `before|after`.

```
 <ax-avatar
      size="medium"
      img="https://www.fillmurray.com/140/140"
      matBadgeSize="meidam"
      matBadge="1"
      matBadgePosition="above after"
      matBadgeOverlap="true"
></ax-avatar>
```

**Badge sizing**

The badge has 3 sizes: `small`, `medium` and `large`. By default, the badge is set to `medium`. You can change the size by adding matBadgeSize to the host element.

```
 <ax-avatar
      [size]="avatarSize"
      name="John Doe"
      matBadgeSize="meidam"
      matBadge="1"
></ax-avatar>

```

**Badge color**

The badge has 3 colors: `informational`, `dark` and `light`. By default, the badge is set to `informational`. You can change the color by adding matBadgeColor to the host element.

```
 <ax-avatar
      [size]="avatarSize"
      name="John Doe"
      matBadgeSize="meidam"
      matBadge="1"
      matBadgeColor="informational"
></ax-avatar>

```

** We need notifer function in app level to impletment the `+` symbol after hitting `999`. Notifier function example provided below.\***

```

 @Input() set badgeNumber(value: string | number) {
    this._badgeCount = value > 999 ? '999+' : value;
  }
  get badgeNumber() {
    return this._badgeCount;
  }

```

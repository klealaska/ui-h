# Dialog

## Imports

Component - `import { DialogV2Component } from '@ui-coe/shared/ui-v2';`

Interface - `import { DialogDataV2 } from '@ui-coe/shared/ui-v2';`

## Description

Please check out the `DialogDataV2` interface to see all values that can be passed into the data object

## Modal Dialog

Modal Dialog can me implemented by first calling the `dialog.open` method in Angular Material and passing in the `DialogV2Component`.
Then passing in an `object` into the `data` property.
You should type this `Object` with `DialogDataV2` before passing it into the property.
When the dialog is closed, it will emit the data object and the button that was clicked.

```
data: DialogDataV2 = {
    draggable: false,
    ...
}

OpenDialog() {
    const dialogRef = this.dialog.open(DialogV2Component, {
        data: this.data,
    });
}
```

## Non-Modal Dialog

Non-Modal Dialog can me implemented the same way but you will want to change `draggable` property in the `data` object to `draggable: true`
Also, add `hasBackdrop: false` to the `dialog.open` method.
When the dialog is closed, it will emit the data object and the button that was clicked.

```
data: DialogDataV2 = {
    draggable: true,
    ...
}

OpenDialog() {
    const dialogRef = this.dialog.open(DialogV2Component, {
        hasBackdrop: false,
        data: this.data,
    });
}
```

## Content Projection

These two components can also utilize content projection.
You should create another component in your app and pass any components in to the `ax-dialog-v2` component.
Use your component as the main dialog component.
You should also update the `data` objects type to include any data you're wanting to pass into your component.

```
data: DialogDataV2 | CustomData = {
    draggable: true,
    ...
}

OpenDialog() {
    const dialogRef = this.dialog.open(CustomComponent, {
        hasBackdrop: false,
        data: this.data,
    });
}
```
